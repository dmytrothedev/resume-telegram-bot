# 🤖 Resume Telegram Bot

A **personal Telegram bot** built with Python and the `python-telegram-bot` library.  
It introduces me — **Dmytro Khmeliuk** — as a developer and provides interactive information via inline buttons.

## 🧠 About the Project

This bot allows users to:
- View my **contacts**, **projects**, and **personal info**
- Interact via **inline buttons** with a clean asynchronous flow
- Get instant responses without delay thanks to **async handlers**
- Navigate smoothly using callback logic

The bot was designed as a personal “digital business card” and runs entirely on Python.
